# VERMONT DIAL-A-RIDE PRELIMINARY WEB APP

Using a combination of routing algorithms, API calls, and django to change the current dial a ride system in Vermont.
  
# Background
This is a Dial-A-Ride Optimization problem tailored to the state of Vermontâ€™s transit needs. Currently, there is no website or algorithm in place were users can submit requests to be picked up by a dial a ride driver in Vermont. We hope to change that with a website that can handle requests, and efficiently schedule a path that efficiently maximizes the number of requests each driver can serve.
  
# Usage
For Usage, visit the page: [(sgakuya.pythonanywhere.com)] 

### Ride Request
1. To test the ride creation process, click on Rider Login on the menu bar.
2. Register as a new user and fill in the form with the info about the ride you are requesting and confirm.
3. You can also check out your previously requested rides on the page after logging in.

### Schedule Creation and Simulation
