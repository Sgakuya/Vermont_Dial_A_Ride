###### Vermont Dial a Ride Preliminary Website #####

Using a combination of routing algorithms, API calls, and django to change the current dial a ride system in Vermont.
  
  
  ### Background
  This is a Dial-A-Ride Optimization problem tailored to the state of Vermontâ€™s transit needs. Currently, there is no website or algorithm in place were users can submit requests to be picked up by a dial a ride driver in Vermont. We hope to change that with a website that can handle requests, and efficiently schedule a path that efficiently maximizes the number of requests each driver can serve.
